    "Reinforcement learning is learning what to do - how to map situations to actions - so as to maximize a numerical reward signal. The learner must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. The idea here is the loop of cases, actions may affect not only the immediate reward but also the next situation and, through that, all subsequent rewards. "

    "One challenges of this area is the trade-off between __exploration__ and __exploitation__. To obtain a lot of reward, the agent must prefer actions that it has tried in the past and found to be effective in producing a reward (exploitation). But to discover such actions, it has to try actions that it has not selected before (exploration). The dilemma is that neither exploration nor exploitation ca be pusued exclusively without failing at the task. On a stochastic task, each action must be tried many times to gain a reliable estimate of its expected reward. "
